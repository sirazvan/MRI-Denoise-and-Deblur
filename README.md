# MRI Denoise and Deblur

A collection of deep learning and classical algorithms for removing noise and blur from brain MRI scans. This project implements and evaluates five methodsâ€”DnCNN, CNNâ€‘DMRI, RIDNet, Uâ€‘Net Lite, and Richardsonâ€“Lucy deconvolutionâ€”on synthetically corrupted MRI images, comparing their performance in terms of MSE, SSIM, and PSNR.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Five Restoration Methods**  
  - **DnCNN**: Residual CNN for AWGN removal  
  - **CNNâ€‘DMRI**: Encoderâ€“decoder network for Rician noise  
  - **RIDNet**: Residualâ€‘inâ€‘Residual Dense Network with Feature Attention  
  - **Uâ€‘Net Lite**: Lightweight Uâ€‘Net variant  
  - **Richardsonâ€“Lucy**: Classical deconvolution baseline  

- **Dataset Preparation**  
  - Public Kaggle brain MRI dataset  
  - Four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, no tumor  
  - Artificial motion blur and AWGN (Ïƒ = 0.15) applied  

- **Evaluation**  
  - Quantitative metrics: MSE, SSIM, PSNR  
  - Qualitative comparisons: example triplets and histograms  
  - Two scenarios: motion blur only, motion blurâ€¯+â€¯noise  

- **Reproducible Pipeline**  
  - 60/20/20 train/val/test splits  
  - Standardized preprocessing (256Ã—256 grayscale, normalization)  
  - Early stopping and checkpointing
